## The Generation of Three-photon GHZ-like state with Classical Light (PI: Y. KIM)
### ABSTRACT
Quantum information built upon the concept of quantum bit (or qubit) deals
with the information processing tasks based on the laws of quantum
mechanics. Its specialty especially stands out in quantum communication (QC)
where Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol allows participants to
generate a common string of secret bits in the presence of an eavesdropper.
Although most of QKD protocols have suggested based on ideal photon
sources, pseudo-single-photon sources such as weak coherent laser pulses are
more favorably used in real QC for practical reason. Despite its random
nature in the photon number distribution, laser pulses can act almost like
photons on some conditions. The quantum-ness criteria is still so ambiguous
that it needs to be clear. Defining more clear boundary will allow us to
evaluate the power of classical light and use it more wisely for QC. Bell
state measurement (BSM) is a projective measurement onto Bell states and
plays crucial roles in many photonic quantum processing application. To
resolve the dilemma of original BSM schemes, an informationally symmetric
BSM scheme was proposed recently. Inspired by this research, a three-photon
GHZ state generator was developed and genuine GHZ state was produced
with entangled photon pairs. However, given practicality, it is worth to
conduct the GHZ state generation experiment with classical lights, which is
exactly what we did in this research. We generate a GHZ-like state with the
use of unsynchronous AOMs and a GHZ state generator. Then we analyze an
output state theoretically and experimentally. We find that experimental data
from QST, that is density matrices, are compatible with theoretical ones. The
generation of a GHZ-like state with classical light turns out successful. Even
though they are not perfect GHZ states with additional diagonal terms in its
density matrix, these imperfection can be dealt with by outstanding
advantages of MDI-QKD. When applied to MDI-QKD, the GHZ-like state is
expected to be used in many kind of practical multiparty quantum
communication.

## Boson Sampling for Harry
### ABSTRACT
This presentation material was part of my voluntary mini-project and was prepared for other interns and students at the centerâ€”especially Harry, who showed interest in learning more about boson sampling after attending Prof. J. Huh's invited talk.
